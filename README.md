The following scripts are unrelated scripts, kept in one place, to demonstrate my scripting abilities. They are kept in their own folders to keep input and output files sorted.

The scripts so far and their purposes are as follows

- first_sed_script: Simple as said. I wanted to make one unclean copy-paste from a PDF more readable, so I used sed.

- scan_join: I already knew the sequence of commands I was executing in zsh to do this one task that I was doing often, so I put it in a Python script. It reads then deletes pdf's scanned to one particular USB then collates them using one of MacOS's builtins.
