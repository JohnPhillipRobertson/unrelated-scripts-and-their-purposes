The following scripts are unrelated scripts, kept in one place, to demonstrate my scripting abilities. They are kept in their own folders to keep input and output files sorted.

The scripts so far and their purposes are as follows

-first_sed_script: Simple as said. I wanted to make one unclean copy-paste from a PDF more readable, so I used sed.

-scan_join: I already knew the sequence of commands I was executing in zsh to do this one task that I was doing often, so I put it in a Python script. It reads then deletes pdf's scanned to one particular USB then collates them using one of MacOS's builtins.

-60s_most_popular: I wrote a comment on a video with the most popular songs from the 60s and wanted to programmatically see who got the most hits. I wrote the Python bit before someone pointed out that the same could be done with uniq, but I left it there to show that I can implement the same functionality.

-servicenow-stuff: These aren't meant to be run, only read for their comments. It's not worth it to make a PDI for them; I just put interesting things I wrote for work (which my contract permits) here.
